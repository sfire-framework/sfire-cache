## Introduction

Apcu Cache Adapter is based on storing cache in [APCU](https://www.php.net/apcu) which implements an in memory data caching functionality. When performing an expensive operation, like reading a file or fetch a network resource, you can store the result in the cache to speed up a later request of the same object.
The only downside of APCu is that itâ€™s local to the machine it runs on, and local to the PHP process and system. This means that if you use PHP as a FastCGI process (e.g. Nginx and php-fpm) every PHP process will have its own cache. Unless you expect to run your application on multiple servers or processes APCU is a good caching mechanism.     



## Requirements

- [APCU](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php) should be installed



## Installation

Install this package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```shell script
composer require sfire-framework/sfire-cache
```



## Setup

### Namespace
```php
use sFire\Cache\Adapter\Apcu;
```



### Instance

```php
$cache = new Apcu();
```



### Configuration

There are no configuration settings available for the Apcu Cache Adapter. Note that this packages relies on [APCU](https://www.php.net/apcu) and therefore must be installed as an extension. APCU may also be used in the [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), but needs an extra setting to do so in `apcu.ini`:
```
apc.enable_cli=on
```



## Usage

#### Retrieving data from cache
To retrieve data, you have to use the `get()` method. If the data exists and is not expired, it will return the data type save. If an item does not or no longer exists, it will return `null` as default. 
You can use the second parameter to overwrite the default value to return when the value for the provided key does not exists.


##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> get(mixed $key, mixed $default);
```

##### Example 1: Retrieving data
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
$cache -> get('foo'); //Output "bar"
```

##### Example 2: Setting a default value
Will return "baz" if the key foo does not exist or is expired.
```php
$cache -> get('quez', 'baz'); //Output "baz"
```



#### Storing data in cache

Storing data will always require a key for retrieval of the data after storing. Data is serialized for data type dependency. If you store an integer, it will come out as an integer. See the [Types of data](#types-of-data)" section for compatible data types.
The default expiration is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Expiration will always be the amount of seconds from the moment of store.

##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> set(mixed $key, mixed $value, [int $seconds = 300]);
```

##### Example: Storing data
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
$cache -> get('foo'); //Output: "bar"
```



#### Removing data from cache

You can manually expire keys by calling the `expire()` method. The data is no longer available due to permanent deletion and thus cannot be recovered.

##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> expire(mixed $key);
```

##### Example: Removing data based on a given key
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
$cache -> get('foo'); //Output "bar"
$cache -> expire('foo');
$cache -> get('foo'); //Output null
```


#### Renewing expiration of stored data
The `touch()` method can renew the expiration time of a stored data based on a given key.

##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> touch(mixed $key);
```

##### Example: Renewing expiration time
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
sleep(5);
$cache -> touch('foo'); //Resets the lifetime
```



#### Check if cache exists

The `exists()` method will return a bool `true` or `false` if cache exists based on a given key.

##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> exists(mixed $key);
```


##### Example: Check if cache exists
```php
$cache -> exists('foo'); //Returns false
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
$cache -> exists('foo'); //Returns true
```


#### Clear all cache data
The `clear()` method will delete all stored cache data.  The data is no longer available due to permanent deletion and thus cannot be recovered.

##### Syntax
```php
$cache -> clear();
```

##### Example: Clearing all data
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar');
$cache -> clear();
$cache -> get('foo'); //Returns null
```



## Examples

### Anti-brute force based on remote ip address
```php
function isIpBruteForcing() {

    $cache  = new Apcu(); //Create new Apcu cache instance
    $key    = 'anti-brute-force-' .  $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']; //Define a key with the client IP address
    $amount = $cache -> get($key, 0); //Retrieve the amount of hits, default 0
    $cache -> set($key, $amount++, 10000); //Increase the amount and store it in cache
    
    return $amount > 5;
}

isIpBruteForcing();
```



## Notes

### Chaining
Most of the provided methods may be chained together:
```php
$cache -> set('foo', 'bar') -> exists();
```



### Data types

The following data is supported for storing:

- Strings - Character strings of arbitrary size in any PHP-compatible encoding.
- Integers - All integers of any size supported by PHP, up to 64-bit signed.
- Floats - All signed floating-point values.
- Boolean - True and false.
- Null - The actual null value.
- Arrays - Indexed, associative and multidimensional arrays of arbitrary depth.
- Object - Any object that supports lossless serialization and deserialization such that `$o == unserialize(serialize($o))`. Objects may leverage PHP's Serializable interface, `__sleep()` or `__wakeup()` magic methods.
